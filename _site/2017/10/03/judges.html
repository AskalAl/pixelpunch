<p>Join Vox Media on Tuesday, November 7 at 6:30pm for an interstellar night of pixel pushing at its finest.</p>

<p>In this 4th year of Pixel Punch, we will be challenging four brave designers do their best Captain Kirk and puzzle their way through galactic challenges guaranteed to test their creativity, fortitude and ability to think on their feet. We’re excited to bring together friends, new and old, to explore new solar systems together. We’ve got the starship, you bring your skills.</p>
