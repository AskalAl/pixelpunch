Join Vox Media on Tuesday, October 25th at 6:30pm for a thrilling night of pixel pushing at its finest. In this 3rd year of Pixel Punch, we will be challenging five brave designers do their best Van Helsing and puzzle their way through spooky challenges guaranteed to test their creativity, fortitude and ability to think on their feet. We’re excited to bring together friends, new and old, to puzzle out mysteries together. We’ll bring the spook, you bring your skills. By attending or partcipating in Pixel Punch, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct.
